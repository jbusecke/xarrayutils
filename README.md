# A collection of various tools for data analysis built on top of xarray and xgcm

This package contains a variety of utility functions I have used in the past few years for data analysis.

Please be aware that I am currently refactoring a lot of the code, which might cause breaking changes.

Hopefully soon it will be better tested and documented.

## Installation

To install from source use pip:

`pip install git+https://github.com/jbusecke/xarrayutils.git`

> Make sure to install these packages to your environment `conda install astropy gsw cartopy`

> In order to use dask > 2.0 you need the newest upstream xarray version. For xarray <= 0.14.1, please downgrade to dask < 2.0

### Converting between vertical coordinate systems

`xarrayutils.vertical_coordinates` provides several tool to move between various vertical ocean grids, e.g. z, density, sigma or hybrid coordinates. See [this notebook](https://github.com/jbusecke/xarrayutils/blob/master/doc/vertical_coords.ipynb) for an early example.

### Plotting utilities
`xarrayutils.plotting` provides several small utility functions to make common tasks I find in my workflow in matplotlib easier. [Examples](doc/plotting.ipynb)

### Utilities for large scale climate data analysis
`xarrayutils.utils` provides some helpful tools to simplify common tasks in climate data
analysis workflows. [This notebook](doc/utils.ipynb), provides some examples on how to
use linear regression, work with multi-member data and seperate mixed layer values.
